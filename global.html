<BR>                <h2 style="color:grey;">Some benefit, others fall behind Findings in the Report* show the strong uptake of e-commerce across regions, with consumers in emerging economies making the greatest shift to online shopping.
    <BR> <BR>Latin America’s online marketplace Mercado Libre, for example, sold twice as many items per day in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the same period the previous year. And African e-commerce platform Jumia reported a 50% jump in transactions during the first six months of 2020. China’s online share of retail sales rose from 19.4% to 24.6% between August 2019 and August 2020. In Kazakhstan, the online share of retail sales increased from 5% in 2019 to 9.4% in 2020.  Thailand saw downloads of shopping apps jump 60% in just one week during March 2020.        
    <BR> <BR>The trend towards e-commerce uptake seen in 2020 is likely to be sustained during recovery, the report says.But in many of the world’s least developed countries, consumers and businesses haven’t capitalized on pandemic-induced e-commerce opportunities due to persistent barriers. Report* says that actions that should be taken by stakeholder groups to ensure more inclusive benefits from e-commerce.
    <BR> <BR> “Countries that harness the potential of e-commerce will be better placed to benefit from global markets for their goods and services in this digitalizing economy, while those that fail to do so risk falling behind even further,” said Shamika N. Sirimanne, UNCTAD’s technology and logistics director.
