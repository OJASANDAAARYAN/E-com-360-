                                    <h1 style="color:grey;">In years to come, we will look back at 2020 as the moment that changed everything. As lockdowns became the new normal, businesses and consumers increasingly “went digital”, providing and purchasing more goods and services online, raising e-commerce’s share of global retail trade from 14% in 2019 to about 17% in 2020. 
                                    <BR> <BR>Against this background, the role of <A HREF="https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/e-commerce">e-commerce</A> has grown immensely. It’s not just niche items being ordered online anymore; in 2020, over 50% of all consumers used direct-to-consumer sales channels to buy everyday items like groceries, cleaning products and other consumer-packaged goods. In fact, online grocery sales more than doubled, growing 54% last year and nearly reaching the $100 million mark. 
                                    <BR> <BR>Nowhere else has unprecedented and unforeseen growth occurred as in the digital and e-commerce sectors, which have boomed amid the COVID-19 crisis. Amid slowing economic activity, COVID-19 has led to a surge in e-commerce and accelerated digital transformation. Digital solutions are increasingly needed to continue some of the economic and social activities remotely. They have been critical for telemedicine, telework and online education, not least to keep alive our social ties in times of physical distancing. We have also witnessed e-commerce growth in developing countries, with long-term implications.
                                    <BR> <BR>These and other findings are showcased in a new report,<A HREF="https://unctad.org/webflyer/covid-19-and-e-commerce-global-review">COVID-19 and E-Commerce: A Global Review</A>, by UNCTAD and eTrade for all partners, reflecting on the powerful global and regional industry transformations recorded throughout 2020.
