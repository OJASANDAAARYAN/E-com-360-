        During the pandemic , Brick and Mortar stores reported a steep drop in sales , while E-commerce giants such as Amazon ,Flipkart and Bigbasket's sales were through the roof.This was because how enticing Online shopping was.Slowly and slowly brick and mortar stores are losing significance and e-commerce clearly is the way to go ! Large retail chains and groups must also start there own online e-commerce portals to sustain themselves.
